# WordPress & React Integration Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate a WordPress backend with a React frontend using the WordPress REST API. The project fetches and displays posts and other content from WordPress using REST API calls with Axios in React, instead of GraphQL, making it straightforward to manage WordPress content dynamically within a React application.

## Project Overview

This project enables seamless data interaction between a WordPress backend and a React frontend. Previously, GraphQL and Apollo Client were used for data fetching; however, this version demonstrates a shift to the WordPress REST API with Axios for efficient RESTful communication.

### How It Works
- The WordPress REST API is set up to expose posts and other data in JSON format.
- Axios in the React frontend sends HTTP requests to WordPress's REST API endpoints to fetch and manipulate this data.
- WordPress sends the requested data back to the React app, which then dynamically renders it for end users.

### Key Files and Code
- **WordPress Backend**: Uses standard WordPress REST API endpoints (e.g., `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`).
- **React Frontend**: Components make API requests using Axios, handle the response, and display data (e.g., post titles, authors, and content).
- 
## Features

- **Dynamic Content Fetching**: Fetches WordPress posts and categories in real-time.
- **Authentication with Nonces**: Uses WordPress nonces for secure API requests.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Organized React components for modular and maintainable code.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have:
- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **WordPress** (v5.0+ recommended)
- **PHP** and **MySQL** (for WordPress)
- **Local Server** (like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP for WordPress development)

## Installation

### Step 1: Set up the WordPress Backend
1. Install WordPress locally on your server (e.g., `http://localhost/my-site`).
2. Enable the WordPress REST API by ensuring youâ€™re using WordPress v4.7+ (REST API is enabled by default).
3. If needed, install a CORS-enabling plugin like **WP Add Custom Headers** to manage cross-origin access.

### Step 2: Set up the React Frontend
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   
### Install dependencies
npm install

Usage
Start the WordPress Local Server: Make sure your WordPress site is running locally at a URL like http://localhost/my-site.

Configure Environment Variables: In your React project, set up a .env file with the WordPress API base URL, like so:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/my-site/wp-json
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/my-site/wp-json
###3. Run the React Application:
npm start
Your React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or a similar port).
Fetch Data from WordPress:

The application uses Axios in components like PostPage.js to request data from the REST API endpoint (e.g., http://localhost/my-site/wp-json/wp/v2/posts).
Nonces are added to headers for authenticated requests.
Technical Details
This project uses the following technologies:

JavaScript & React: JavaScript powers the frontend, while React components handle UI rendering and state management.
Axios: Used for making HTTP requests from the React frontend to the WordPress REST API.
WordPress REST API: Provides endpoints for accessing posts, categories, authors, etc., in JSON format.
Authentication with WordPress Nonces: When fetching data requiring authentication, WordPress nonces are included in the header to validate the request.

Troubleshooting
CORS Errors
If you encounter a CORS error:

Make sure your WordPress site allows cross-origin requests by adding the necessary headers. Plugins like WP Add Custom Headers can help with this.
401 Unauthorized Errors
If you receive a 401 Unauthorized error:

Verify that your requests include the WordPress nonce for authentication, especially for endpoints that require user permissions.
